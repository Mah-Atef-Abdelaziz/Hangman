The game starts with a secret word chosen from a list of words.
The player's objective is to guess the word letter by letter.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's figure is drawn.
The player wins if they guess the word before the entire hangman is drawn, and they lose if the hangman is completed before they guess the word.
